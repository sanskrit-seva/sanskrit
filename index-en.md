1.  Development of Sanskrit Free/Libre and Open framework for global welfare.
2.  Innovations and Solutions in Sanskrit: Knowledge bases and references for global welfare.


<a id="org9642c1b"></a>

## Rationale


<a id="orgc4d7506"></a>

### Consciousness is the core of our very existence

1.  Consciousness, though undefined, is all pervasive and appears in various forms.
2.  Consciousness is what makes us humans, it can be practically defined as the collective of notion of self, identity, philosophy, world view, knowledge, intelligence, being, purpose, direction, ideals, values, psychology and harmony within and with environment.
3.  Consciousness at all levels, individual to collective, manifests as our actions and circumstances.
4.  Consciousness is the central axiom as soul or God in various spiritual frameworks.
5.  Consciousness is at the forefront of scientific research as it is seen as emerging phenomenon out of synergy of large number of the order of 10<sup>11</sup> neurons in the brain. Biology tries to understand the anatomy and biochemistry of consciousness. Physics tries to understand consciousness in terms of statistical mechanics. Mathematics views consciousness as huge graph theory problem. Cosmology has its own philosophical containment problem, wherein it is not clear whether the universe is inside the brain or the brain is inside the universe. Conscious observer forms the basis of Quantum Theory, without itself being defined.
6.  Consciousness is also at the forefront of technological research as artificial intelligence. Computer technology research tries to simulate consciousness.
7.  Human body itself can be viewed as extension of brain or the seat of consciousness.
8.  Brain is a huge electrical circuit for an engineer.
9.  Internet can be viewed as emerging global consciousness.


<a id="org3e68f96"></a>

### Unhealthy consciousness manifests as sad state of world

1.  In spite of, or because of abuse of, the so called technical progress or the advent of knowledge age, we most sadly witness on an average individually and collectively, that we have failed to even survive and are facing real danger of mass extinction, all due to reasons that can be traced back to serious problems in consciousness. Unhealthy mass human consciousness can wipe out the human race.
2.  Can there be any other question more important than this question of our very survival? Every other concern is secondary.
3.  Love your neighbour if you love your children.
4.  So while understanding the consciousness itself is one of the hardest theoretical problem that evades clear definition even, it is the most urgent need to realign the consciousness at all levels with Nature. Humans are the only life forms that are not aligned with Nature. Unfortunately the extent of non alignment with Nature is proportional to the technological progress.


<a id="org89369ae"></a>

### Technology magnifies the effect of consciousness

1.  Can the technology itself be the cause of human affairs or the human consciousness that uses the technology for various motives? Technology as an instrument is like a sharp knife that can be used for any purpose; in the hands of inexperienced it can be dangerous, in the hands of a surgeon with malicious intent, it can take life or steal organs and in the hands of a well intent surgeon it can save life.
2.  Even though we may not individually or collectively understand consciousness per se to our level of satisfaction, yet we need to live healthy life practically as individuals and as collective. Healthy life itself can be defined as living in resonance with Nature.


<a id="org90b58ad"></a>

### Consciousness aligned with Nature is the key to healthy existence

1.  Healthy consciousness is the basis of healthy life. Today consciousness urgently needs healing.
2.  Technology is not the cause of unhealthy consciousness responsible for deplorable and dangerous global situation. Yet technology has been used for leveraging the impact, from mass killing atom bomb to the mass consciousness controlling internet. The same technology as a sharp knife can and should be used collectively in ever ingenious ways by the best brains with Nature aligned (right) and kind hearted consciousness.
3.  All actions with mind, body or senses of a Nature aligned consciousness is for self purification only (Gita 5.11). In this sense right action is its own instant reward as a step in constant realignment with Nature. We need to welcome similar thoughts or pearls of wisdom from all thinkers and scriptures around the world to celebrate our unity in diversity as humans.
4.  An important project can be to initiate a reflexive database of spiritual, philosophical and value system frameworks so that people can genuinely cooperate while functioning in their native framework. This is a generalization to human affairs, of sandboxed application with foreign function interface, pilbox on Android is an example.

*sanskrit.org.in continues to draw inspiration from the following and similar successful noble initiatives.*

2.  PicoLisp Philosophy

    <p class="verse">
    Perfection is attained<br />
    not when there is nothing left to add<br />
    but when there is nothing left to take away.<br />
    (Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry)<br />
    </p>
    
    1.  Useful
    2.  Simple
    3.  Small
    4.  Predictable
    5.  Understandable
    6.  Complete control
    7.  Transparency: One knows everything about the internal machinery, because the internal implementation is drastically simplified to the core.
    8.  Unifying by using the same syntax and philosophy all along the way.  Unifying Language for Database and User Interface Development is a blessing.
    
    1.  Reference excerpts
    
        1.  <https://software-lab.de/doc/ref.html>
        
            The PicoLisp Machine
            An important point in the PicoLisp philosophy is the knowledge about the architecture and data structures of the internal machinery. The high-level constructs of the programming language directly map to that machinery, making the whole system both understandable and predictable.
            
            This is similar to assembly language programming, where the programmer has complete control over the machine.
        
        2.  <https://picolisp.com/wiki/?pros-and-cons>
        
        3.  <https://picolisp-explored.com/concepts-and-data-types>
        
            In most modern programming languages, this is intransparent for the programmer, who shouldn't know and also shouldn't care. This is a big difference to the PicoLisp philosophy and one of the main reasons why it is so interesting to learn:
            
            In PicoLisp, you know everything about the internal machinery.
            
            And the reason for this is because the internal implementation is drastically simplified to the core. The high-level constructs of the programming language directly map to that machinery, making it understandable and predictable. In this regards, it is similar to assembly language programming, where the programmer has complete control over the machine.
        
        4.  <https://picolisp.com/wiki/?unifyinglanguage>
        
            by using the same syntax and philosophy all along the way.
        
        5.  <https://picolisp.com/wiki/!getBlob?-A300>
        
            The philosophy of cross-compiling a program for the target seems to be the most
            popular choice among microcontroller aficionados.

            &#x2026; A Radical Approach to Application Development (PDF) and A Unifying Language for Database And User Interface Development are the next logical steps to learn more about the philosophy behind PicoLisp.

### Paradigms of Success in technology cooperation - On a technical note

1.  Recent radical philosophical frameworks and practical idealism by brilliant philanthropic visionary programmers in Computer Science and their ubiquitous fruits for global welfare in form of Free/Libre and Open Source Software FLOSS in general and PicoLisp Philosophy in particular provide a solid reason that there is still hope for humanity, provided we recognise the infinite potential of this "new paradigm of success of objective human ingenuity and global cooperation in and through CS/IT", and the urgent need to develop and scale, various innovative and transparent solutions by rising and synergizing beyond traditional academic boundaries, to heal life on Earth, that is almost facing extinction, on the most urgent and vital fronts such as food, biodiversity, simple living and cooperation etc. crucial for the very survival of life on Earth.
2.  These new CS/IT philosophical frameworks of cooperation and technology themselves can be generalized, combined and extended to define and make philosophical frameworks for almost all objective domains such as Free/Libre and Open Source Education FOSE, Free/Libre and Open Source Agriculture FLOSA, Free/Libre and Open Source Cooperation FOSC, and others. Here free means freedom to explore, experiment and experience in the ways not possible in the money based market system.


<a id="orga98caed"></a>

### Synergy of successful frameworks is needed

1.  Radical philosophical frameworks hold the key to survival and success at all levels, individual to global. What urgently remains to be explored is the synergy of such proven successful frameworks as a meta open philosophical framework.
2.  Such frameworks have existed for centuries, now there is urgent need to rediscover, redefine and extend them for present and future. Shining paradigm of such successful radical philosophical frameworks is Sanskrit which is universal in scope.


<a id="org833f090"></a>

### Sanskrit Free/Libre and Open framework for global welfare - Open ended evolving framework of frameworks

1.  Sanskrit is a radical objective philosophical framework that has stood the test of time in the fields of formal natural language grammar, programming, algorithmic brevity, simplicity, being open ended for future and based on human anatomy as objective grounds and has provided basis for composition and preservation of some of the finest creations of human mind in both the subjective and objective.
2.  Sanskrit is the first and finest virtual machine for the hardware provided by human mind.  Sanskrit and German language grammars are very similar, pointing to common origin. Germany is at the frontier of research in Sanskrit and related fields.
3.  Sanskrit connects all fields of past and present, hence it is most appropriate as an umbrella term for innovative solutions and synergy of radical philosophical frameworks of horizontal cooperation in various domains that still hold hope for humanity and all life on Earth.


<a id="orge631639"></a>

### Sanskrit and PicoLisp

1.  In the spirit of clear and concise grammar and resultant useful power with universal scope of application, Sanskrit and PicoLisp are perfect match.
2.  With global welfare as its sole objective, non-profit sanskrit.org.in aims to play the role of such meta framework, powered by PicoLisp at its core to bring database based human and machine synergy to unlock immense potential for all.
3.  With aim to give something vital and crucial to global society in the field of CS/IT education, agriculture, food and health by using PicoLisp to trigger mobile app and database based mentorships and internships, farm, food and health management for all levels from individual to community of students, farmers and hobbyists. This unique welfare initiative shall be based on Sanskrit extension of PicoLisp both in philosophy and literally much in the academic spirit of the Germany based Software-Lab.

## Sanskrit Social Business Model - Supports various players as a huge banyan tree

1.  Employees get salary.
2.  Philanthropic social business investors are capital providers donating time value of their capital. They get immense satisfaction but no dividends.
3.  Members are special philanthropic social business investors who give additional guarantee, in our case as "limited by guarantee" company and donate their capital as social goodwill, money, skill, energy and time.
4.  Donors get tax exemption, immense satisfaction and sanskrit.org.in pioneered extreme contingency insurance as additional layer of security on compassionate grounds.
